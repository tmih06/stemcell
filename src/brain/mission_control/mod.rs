//! Mission Control — data services
//!
//! Aggregates and adapts data from existing OpenCrabs subsystems
//! (`rsi_proposals`, RSI improvements log, cron registry, approval queue)
//! into uniform per-panel types the TUI renderer consumes.
//!
//! Each service is a small, stateless function that pulls fresh data on
//! demand. There's deliberately no caching here — Mission Control is
//! a read-mostly UI that re-fetches on draw. If panels grow expensive
//! we can add a cheap snapshot layer behind the same trait.
//!
//! Layout:

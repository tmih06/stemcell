//! Mission Control rendering — top-level entry + per-panel renderers.
//!
//! See `src/brain/mission_control/` for the matching data services and
//! `src/tui/app/mission_control/` for the input/state layer. Each panel
//! is rendered by its own submodule so the file boundaries match the
//! visual ones — adding a 4th panel is a new file, not a diff inside
//! a 1k-line `dispatch.rs`.

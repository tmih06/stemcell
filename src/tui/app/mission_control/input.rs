//! Keyboard handling for `AppMode::MissionControl`.
//!
//! Three layers:
//!
//!  1. Detail popup open → Esc closes the popup. j/k still scroll the
//!     selection underneath so the popup updates as the user moves.
//!  2. Panel focused, no popup → Tab/Shift-Tab cycle panels;
//!     j/k or ↑/↓ move selection within the focused panel; Enter
//!     opens the detail popup; Esc closes MC entirely.
//!  3. Apply / reject (`a` / `r`) land in C12 alongside the
//!     `rsi_proposals` action plumbing.
//!
//! The decision logic is split into a pure `decide` function that takes
//! a `&mut McState` plus the current panel item count, and returns a
//! `KeyOutcome`. The `handle_key` wrapper at the top routes that
//! outcome back into `App`-level effects (mode switch on Close). This
//! keeps the keystroke logic unit-testable without spinning up a full
//! `App`.

//! Keyboard handling for `AppMode::SkillsList`.
//!
//! Dialog model: a single filterable list. The text input layer is
//! implicit — every printable char that isn't a recognised navigation
//! key appends to the filter, which lets type-to-narrow work without
//! an explicit focus toggle. Tab / Shift-Tab / ↑ / ↓ / j / k navigate
//! the filtered list; Enter executes the selected skill; Esc closes.
//!
//! `decide` is pure (mutates `SkillsDialogState`, returns `KeyOutcome`)
//! so the keystroke contract is unit-testable without spinning up a
//! full `App`.

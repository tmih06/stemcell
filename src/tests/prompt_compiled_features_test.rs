//! Tests for `compiled_features` and the "self-awareness" prompt

//! onboarded user asked the agent to "implement local STT and TTS",
//! and the agent started coding from scratch — local-stt and
//! local-tts are default features with working backends. The agent
//! had no way to know they were compiled in, and no directive
//! telling it to check first.

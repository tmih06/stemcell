//! Tests for the `plan` tool's trigger-criteria description.
//!
//! Issue: the agent was rarely calling `plan` because the tool
//! description didn't tell it WHEN to plan. A generic "Manage
//! structured task plans" left the agent to guess; it usually
//! skipped planning even on clearly multi-step work.
//!
//! These tests act as sentinels: they fail loudly if a future
//! refactor strips the trigger criteria from the description,
//! reverting plan to its pre-2026-05-30 invisibility.

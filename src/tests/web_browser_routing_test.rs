//! Sentinel tests for the web / GitHub / browser routing rule.
//!
//! Regression context (2026-05-30): on multiple user sessions the
//! agent reached for `browser_navigate` when asked to "check the
//! GitHub PR" or "look up the docs for X" — the right tools were
//! the `gh` CLI via bash and a search tool respectively. Root
//! cause: the tool descriptions said WHAT each tool did but never
//! WHEN to pick it, and the brain preamble had no routing rule.
//!
//! These tests pin three contracts that together force the routing:
//!
//! 1. `BRAIN_PREAMBLE` carries the WEB / GITHUB / BROWSER ROUTING
//!    block so the rule lands in the system prompt every turn
//!    (not just when the user has loaded `TOOLS.md`).
//! 2. `browser_navigate.description` calls out research / GitHub
//!    as the wrong use case — the model sees this in its tool list.
//! 3. The search tools + `bash` carry positive guidance ("prefer
//!    me for X") so the routing rule has somewhere to land.
//!
//! `browser_navigate.description` is checked via `include_str!` of
//! the source file rather than instantiating the tool — the real
//! constructor needs an `Arc<BrowserManager>`, which costs a real
//! Chrome handshake we don't want in a unit test.

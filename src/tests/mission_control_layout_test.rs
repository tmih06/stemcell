//! Tests for `compute` — the pure layout function for Mission Control.
//!
//! Contract: the inbox / activity / schedule / help_bar rects must:
//!   1. Stay strictly inside the outer area.
//!   2. Not overlap each other.
//!   3. Reserve exactly 1 row for the help bar when the area can spare it.
//!   4. Collapse the help bar to 0-height when the area is < 2 rows.

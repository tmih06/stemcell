//! Sentinel tests for the `evolve` tool's systemd restart helpers.
//!
//! Context — PR #137 (#136) added a post-swap step that schedules a
//! delayed `systemctl restart opencrabs*.service` via `systemd-run`.
//! Two gaps from the PR review remained open after merge:
//!
//!   #3  Silent failure when no units match the glob — the agent
//!       would say "Evolved!" and the daemon would never restart
//!       (zero matching units), the exact symptom #136 was filed for.
//!   #6  No test coverage on the restart path — flag drift in
//!       systemd-run args could silently break the restart again.
//!
//! These tests pin both: the systemd-run command construction stays
//! stable across refactors, AND the user-facing message for every
//! `RestartStatus` outcome clearly tells the user what actually
//! happened (or didn't).
//!
//! What we DON'T test: actual systemd interaction. Spawning real
//! `systemd-run` requires a Linux host with systemd running, which
//! isn't portable across CI (macOS + Windows have no systemd).
//! Construction + message shape is what we can pin portably; the
//! end-to-end behaviour was validated empirically by the PR author.

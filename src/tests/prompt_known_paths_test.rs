//! Tests for the `Known paths` runtime-info section that teaches the
//! agent where logs / config / brain files / plans live on disk.
//!
//! Without this section the agent grepped the repo working directory
//! when the user said "check logs", instead of reading
//! `~/.stemcell/logs/stemcell.YYYY-MM-DD`. These tests are
//! sentinels: they fail loudly if a future refactor accidentally
//! strips the path guidance, sending the agent back to wandering.
